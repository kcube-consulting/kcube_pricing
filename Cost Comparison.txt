# Comparison Table: Option 1 vs. Option 2
| Metric               | Option 1 (Fixed Agent Bundles)        | Option 2 (Pay-As-You-Go)          | Key Difference                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Pricing Model        | Fixed cost per agent tier                | Slab-wise hourly rates (lower with higher usage) | Option 1 is predictable; Option 2 scales with demand. |
| Base Telephony Cost  | $1,200 (1 Agent) ? $12,350 (50 Agents)   | $2.11–$2.50/hour (volume discounts)   | Option 2 wins for mid-range usage (e.g., 5–25 Agents). |
| Outbound Cost        | +10% of base                             | +10% of hourly rate                   | Identical markup, but Option 2’s base rate is cheaper. |
| Cost Efficiency      | Best for high-volume (50+ Agents)    | Best for variable/low-volume (1–25 Agents) | Option 1 saves ~15% at 50 Agents. |
| Overage Flexibility  | Fixed overage rate ($1.72–$10/hour)      | No overage (pay only for used hours)   | Option 2 avoids unused capacity costs. |
| Implementation       | $15,000 (one-time)                       | $15,000 (one-time)                    | No difference.                         |
| Commitment           | None (monthly/annual)                    | 12-month minimum                      | Option 1 is more flexible.             |
| Chat/Email Add-ons   | $2,400 (Chat), $1,200 (Email)            | Identical                             | No difference.                         |

- Crossover Point: At ~30 Agents, Option 1 becomes cheaper.

# Strategic Recommendations
1. Choose Option 1 If:  
   - You have stable, high-volume needs (25+ Agents).  
   - You prefer predictable billing and hate surprises.  

2. Choose Option 2 If:  
   - You have fluctuating demand (e.g., seasonal spikes).  
   - You’re a startup/SMB with 1–25 Agents and want lower upfront costs.  

3. Negotiation Tip:  
   - For Option 2, ask for custom slabs (e.g., higher tiers at $1.80/hour for 50+ Agents).  

# Hidden Costs & Warnings
- Outbound Dialer: Both options require customer-provided dialers (+10% cost).  
- Taxes: Not included in either option (add 5–10% depending on region).  
- Overage in Option 1: Exceeding included minutes costs $0.06–$0.17/minute.
